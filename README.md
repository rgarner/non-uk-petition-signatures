# GOV.UK petition signatures from outside the UK

The [Trump State Visit Petition](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928) 
made the news little over a week into Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's #MuslimBan
was protested the world over, and in many cities in the UK.

I was interested in how many people abroad had signed the petition. I'm not sure there's
any requirement or real validity checking on the source of signatures, but it appears that
on the popular petitions, over 95% appear to come from the UK.
